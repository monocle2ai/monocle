Coffee is a hot drink made from the roasted and ground seeds (coffee beans) of a tropical shrub
A latte consists of one or more shots of espresso, served in a glass (or sometimes a cup), into which hot steamed milk is added
Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso shot with hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio, resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors of espresso, but in a lighter way
