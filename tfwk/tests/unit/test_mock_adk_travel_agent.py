Google ADK Travel Agent Example with Monocle Testing Framework (Mock Version)

This example demonstrates:
- Google ADK agent structure and patterns  
- Proper setup_monocle_telemetry() integration
- Monocle Test Framework integration with ADK agents
- Tool instrumentation and trace validation

Note: Uses mock responses to avoid API key requirements while demonstrating
the complete ADK + Monocle integration pattern.
